It's like Bumble, but you can send your match a date.

Rough wireframes are here:

User stories:
- As a prototype user, I can select a male or female account to roleplay
- As a member, I can view my profile
- As a member, I can view member profiles of the opposite sex, and like or dismiss each profile
- As a member, I receive confirmation that a member I like is a match (that member also likes me)
- As a female member, I can send a message to my matches
- As a male member, I can send a message to my matches, if they have messaged me first
- As a male member, I can suggest a date to my matches
- As a female member, I can accept a date suggested to me by one of my matches
- As a member, I can see my scheduled and accepted dates on a calendar
